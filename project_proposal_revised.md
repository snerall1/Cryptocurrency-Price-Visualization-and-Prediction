Author: Sai Sunil Neralla
Date of Submission: 10/30/2022
Keywords: Crypto analysis, Crypto Value prediction, Crypto Currency future value prediction

Description: 
Cryptocurrency has become most popular and fastest means of money transfer in the recent years. This project is to analyze and predict the future value/prices of different crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin etc.. and visualize the predicted results. This project is feasible and requires a dataset of different cryptocurrencies. We can analyze and predict the crypto value using Machine learning with time as a function.

Research Questions:

RO1: To describe the trends of cryptocurrency data over a time period.

RO2: To predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin,ethereum and dogecoin).

RO3: To defend the model for performing cryptocurrency future price prediction in RO2

RO4: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2 and to find relationships between high,low,open and close attributes in the dataset.

Intellectual Merit:
It is important to predict the future value of any cryptocurrency. Accurate predictions can help the investors to take right decisions by investing in the cryptocurrency which lead to potential profits in the future.

Data Sourcing:
The data should be a time series data which has trading features like price, volume, open, low, high. We can get real time data of different cryptocurrencies directly from the web and then we prepare the data for training and testing. The dataset of different cryptocurrencies was retrieved in the .CSV format from the below link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory
